    """ This model is based on a Kneighbors classification with the following configuration:
            - n_neighbors = 7.
            - weights = "uniform".
            - algorithm = "ball_tree".

        It uses 4 features:
            - Average abolute ranking in the training seasons. If a team is in season 2,
                its absolute ranking is considered, adding the teams in season 1.
            - Average net goals (scored - conceded) in the training seasons.
            - Home team, encoded as a number.
            - Away team, encoded as a number.

        The features calculated in the training step (av. ranking and
            net goals) are then considered in the prediction step
            If a team is not found in the training step, it is considered
            to be of a low division and is assigned bad scores.
            This is a good approach if enough training seasons are considered
            (at least 5), with good results when training with 10 seasons (2010-2020).
        
        These features are stored in the file "train_features.json".
